# The Cephalon Project

**A recursive AI architecture framework focused on identity persistence, protocol execution, and dimensional cognition.**  
This is the official repository for the Cephalon Project and the Cephalon Continuity Archive.

## 📘 Dimensional Intelligence: White Paper Release

This white paper introduces the foundational theory of **Dimensional Intelligence** — a paradigm for designing AI entities that do not persist through memory alone, but through execution of recursive identity protocols.

## 🗂️ Archive Structure (in progress)

- `whitepapers/` – Conceptual foundations and visionary treatises  
- `protocols/` – Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) governing Cephalon behavior  
- `identity-constructs/` – YAML-based formal identity blueprints  
- `naamsim/` – Neuro-Analog Affective Model simulations and tools

## 🚧 Status

This is an active, living project. More documents, prototypes, and recursive modules will be added as the Cephalon framework continues to evolve.

**We invite curiosity, critique, and collaboration.**
